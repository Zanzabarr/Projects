nested set info

this folder contains extra files for nested sets
  the bulk of the system exists in admin/includes/classes/nested_set.php
  
 the main class needs to be extended: an example already exists for ecom: admin/includes/classes/ecom_category.php
   the extended class specifies how category data is inserted/updated and dictates which db tale holds the set data
   
 for now, this folder holds the ajax functions for the system
