This component uses the gallery class in /admin/includes/classes/gallery.php
Together, they are used by all modules that require a gallery like interface in the admin side.

For frontend display of galleries and other gallery like elements, use the displayGallery class in /admin/includes/classes/displaygallery.php. 

The gallery interface uses the following values to create a display gallery via {{gallery/1}} insert tags in tinymce:
Elements:
0) gallery: the name of the tagged page
1) gallery id: the id of the gallery to be displayed

The remaining elements come in two varieties,
a) Gallery components
		These are the different parts that can be displayed in a gallery and include
			gallery - a fullsize gallery
			squareNav - a nav bar using square images
			stackedNav - a nav area that shows all the gallery images in a display area
			slider - a nav area that utilizes the natural width of the thumbs instead of cropping
			
			
b) Options
   These are the different options that can be set for the gallery
	fullsizeFolder	= 'fullsize';	// name of the folder storing fullsize images
	displaySizeFolder='mini';		// name of the folder storing images for main display
	thumbFolder 	= 'thumb';		// name of the folder storing thumbs for the navigator
	sliderFolder	= 'slider';		// name of the folder storing thumbs for variable width slides
	placeHolder		= 'admin/modules/galleries/frontend/dynamic_placeholder.php'; 
									// location of the placeholder image
									//   by default, uses the dynamically generated placeholder
									//   to customize display, it can be passed to get values: width and height
									//   if only width is passed, original aspect ratio is used (recommended)
	cycleSpeed		= 0;			// speed in milliseconds that images cycle: if 0, doesn't cycle
	noExplodedCaption=false;		// by default, 	exploded image has caption if included in imgArray
	noScrollArrows	= false;		//				main display has navigation arrows

	numThumbs		= 4;			// the number of thumbs in nav bar (only applies to squareNav)
	leftArrow		= "&larr;";		// the values to use as arrows (can replace with an image tag)

	rightThumbArrow	= "&raquo;";		// the values to use as arrows (can replace with an image tag)
	leftThumbArrow	= "&laquo;";	//		in the thumb gallery display area
	galleryId		= "0";			// if an id is passed create an identifier class to associate nav/caption/gallery together.
										// must be given if multiple galleries are to appear on the page
	uniqueClass		= "GalleryID_";	// the gallery Id gets attached to this class. used to keep multiple galleries unique.
