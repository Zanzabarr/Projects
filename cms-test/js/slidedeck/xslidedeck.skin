 * The SlideDeck slide area.
 * 
 * You can specify a height for the slide area, but it is not required, width
 * will automatically be defined for the slide area and will vary depending on
 * how many slides you have in your SlideDeck.
 * 
 * To add space between a slide and the next slide's spine (slide title bar),
 * increase the border-right definition. To remove the space, just remove the
 * border definition.
 * 
 * SlideDeck slides are all given a unique class, so you can customize the
 * appearance of each slide individually by referencing a slide by its
 * numbered class name. For example:
 *    .slidedeck dd.slide_1
 *    .slidedeck dd.slide_2
 *    .slidedeck dd.slide_3
 *    etc...

 * gap from appearing as the SlideDeck animates.
